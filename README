Introduction
------------

GEZEL is a language and open environment for exploration, simulation,
and implementation of cycle-true hardware models. The models can be
simulated stand-alone, or cosimulated with one of the supported
instruction set simulators. GEZEL models can be automatically
translated into VHDL for hardware synthesis targeting FPGA or ASIC.

The GEZEL core is a C++ library that can be easily integrated into
other system simulation projects. This release includes the GEZEL
library along with several tools:
	- A VHDL Code generator for GEZEL programs
	- A C++  Code generator for GEZEL programs


Installation
------------

Please refer to Appendix A of the user manual.
